          In Defense of My Ego
          <p>
            What's good witcha<br />
            How's your little sister<br />
            Man I heard you put down the swishers<br />
            What you smoking on<br />
            Whatcha girl been choking- (Wait)<br />
            Werent you a virgin<br />
            Heard you got like no bank but you still splurging<br />
            Heard you got a full tank and still not gassed up<br />
            Heard you got some opportunities that you done passed up<br />
            Heard you tryna be up next when you last up<br />
            Heard you got like no zinc left tryna brass up<br />
            Do as I told you<br />
            Less you want a life long career stocking Whole Foods<br />
            Better go goku<br />
            Think like a mogul<br />
            Time is investment make money the focal<br />
            Until you global<br />
            If that's what you want<br />
            Or stay sold and bought<br />
            Unlearn what they taught<br />
            Worst shit in the crock<br />
            Ya chakras stay blocked<br />
            And you stay on the clock<br />
            Better keep that noose taught
          </p>
          <p>
            In defense of my ego<br />
            It got me where I am today
          </p>

          Cycles
          <p>
            I'm at one with moon and the sun (And the sun)<br />
            Hoes change yeah they go then they come (Then they come)<br />
            I'm at one with moon and the sun (And the sun)<br />
            Hoes change yeah they go then they come<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm at one with the moon and the motion of the waves<br />
            Feeling stranded in the ocean no paddle to save<br />
            But I woke up this morning feeling stuck in my ways<br />
            Like I'm unimportant cause I got no play<br />
            Spent too many days outside of the moment<br />
            And yes the key blade made of serotonin<br />
            And I am the Ronin that wields it<br />
            I'm just on earth for a field trip<br />
            I'm a surrealist, looking for realness<br />
            Can't see it in none of you bitches<br />
            I'm on a mission to kill everything in my vision<br />
            I'm cursed to see everything different<br />
            Morpheus said I'm the one
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm at one with moon and the sun (And the sun)<br />
            Hoes change yeah they go then they come (Then they come)<br />
            I'm at one with moon and the sun (And the sun)<br />
            Hoes change yeah they go, then they go, then they go, then they...go
          </p>
          <p>
            I been tryna lift a curse<br />
            In the shadows where demons lurk<br />
            Worse days turn to worse<br />
            Maybe I should save my people first<br />
            Call the plug when it hurt<br />
            Street pharmacy don't need a nurse<br />
            Chaos magician, I flip the prescription<br />
            I'd try something different but I get addicted to everything<br />
            I just get bored the porn is tame<br />
            We turn out different but born the same<br />
            I'm from that 813 Florida gang<br />
            You think you know me you know the name, or<br />
            You know the old me the boy done changed<br />
            I been involved in an energy surge<br />
            Finishing words<br />
            Trapped in a cycle I binge and I purge<br />
            Trapped in a cycle I binge and I purge

          Egoism
          <p>
