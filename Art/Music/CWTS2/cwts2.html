            Driftin' in the cosmos</br>
            I do not toast</br>
          </br>
            Yeah listen here man</br>
            I don't smoke, I don't drink much</br>
            All I do is sit inside my room and I think much</br>
            Coming up clutch</br>
            Had to pop the clutch and switch the lane</br>
            Had to get some different wheels</br>
            Nigga changed, a different name</br>
            Used to be Smiley</br>
            But I never smile now</br>
            All I do is frown now</br>
            You can call me frown clown</br>
            Upside down when the crown turns to a key</br>
            Somehow I got locked inside a lucid dream</br>

          <p>I don't listen to decorum</br>
            Because I am abstract</br>
            I don't have form</br>
            The guillotine looms over my head that's</br>
            Out of the norm</br>
            Children of the corn</br>
            You niggas corny as hell</br>
            I'm Batman stuck in a cell</br>
            "Is that man really going to hell?"</br>
            I ain't going back to where I've been</br>
            The only way out is forward</br>

            This a story of revenge</br>
            I revenging my kin</br>
            I'm avenging my sins</br>
            I will ascend</br>

          Wastin' Away
          <p>Speak for me</br>
          </br>
            I've been wastin' away</br>
            I've been wastin' away</br>
          </br>
            Look</br>
            I just contaminated my mind, and</br>
            I'm just a being living in time</br>
            I told my momma that I was fine</br>
            But I wasn't fine</br>
            I told my mom that I wouldn't lie</br>
            And then I told her another lie</br>
            All I do is speak the truth</br>
            I just dyed my hair blue</br>
            I said that I wouldn't lie</br>
            But I never told the truth</br>
            I was living in my mind, and</br>
            Living on the inside</br>
            I'm tryna fix my insides</br>
            But outside where I gotta go 'cause</br>
          </br>
            I've been wasting away</br>
            I've been wasting away</br>
            I've been wasting away</br>
            I've been wasting away</p>
