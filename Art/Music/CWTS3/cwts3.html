          Black Swordsman
          <p>Separate the bullshit from the authentic</br>
            Stare into the rabbit hole but don't fall in it</br>
            You might never come back that's a long sentence</br>
            Having almost relationships with the wrong women</br>
            Long winded, quick witted, My Broadsword</br>
            Is a burden on my back but it's called for</br>
            Black swordsman, the sacrifice dodging afterlife</br>
            Miss me with that fate, I'mma forge mine</br>
          </br>
            Separate the bullshit from the authentic</br>
            Stare into the rabbit hole but don't fall in it</br>
          </br>
            Separate the bullshit from the authentic</br>
            All my niggas breaking bread so we all winning</br>
            Fantasies in my head and they all women</br>
            Cis, Trans. Don't sip lead don't pop xans</br>
            Outstand, don't overstate, just understand</br>
            You underestimated me with just a hundred mans</br>
            Harley Quinn pigtails tied with rubber bands</br>
            Warrior, traveling to undiscovered lands</br>
          </br>
            Separate the bullshit from the authentic</br>
            Stare into the rabbit hole but don't fall in it</p>
