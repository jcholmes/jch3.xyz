          Inna Forest
          <p>I'm unimportant (Unimportant, unimportant, unimportant)</br>
            I'm just a tree in a forest</br>
            But what's a tree to a florist? (Yeah)</br>
            Unimportant, unimportant (Yeah)</br>
          </br>
            What's important is what really matters</br>
            What's important is what's left when you're just a cadaver</br>
            What's important is what's left when your ego is shattered</br>
            Are you the type that stands up when you're beaten and battered?</br>
            I don't like to flattered, cause I used to be fatter</br>
            Me and you are not the same cause you say you a rapper (Uh)</br>
            And you wanna be faster (Uh)</br>
            Want the people to gather (Uh)</br>
            Middle finger to crackers (Huh)?</br>
            You ain't know you a actor? (Huh huh)</br>
          </br>
            I ain't felt like this here in a long time</br>
            I'm a sucker for big lips and a long lie</br>
            Make me feel like I'm big shit, not the wrong guy</br>
            I was caught in the right place, at the wrong time</br>
            I ain't felt like this here in a long time</br>
            I'm a sucker for big lips and a long lie</br>
            Make me feel like I'm big shit, not the wrong guy</br>

            Unimportant, unimportant (Yeah)</br>
          </br>
            I just got a check</br>
            That shit didn't come in the mail</br>
            She put that shit right in my hand</br>
            That wasn't a flex</br>
            I've come way too far just to fail</br>
            My kingdom will cover the land</br>
            American greed</br>
            I deserve more than I need</br>
            I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees</br>
            And I will never say please</br>
            The only thing matter is me</br>
            I just made the beat</br>
            Yeah I can do anything</br>
            Yeah I can do everything</br>
            I do too many things</br>
            But on the outside of this</br>
            I don't really do anything</br>
            I just think about shit</br>
            Shit I could never control</br>
            Things out of my control, it's mind control</br>
            Everything inside my phone</br>
            That shit is mind control</br>
          </br>
            I'm unimportant (Unimportant, unimportant, unimportant)</br>

          Floatin'
          <p>Floating</br>
            Out in the ocean</br>
            I don't even know where I'm going</br>
            Been a couple months and I haven't been smoking</br>
            I'm the first son so I came with the locusts. I'm</br>
            Floating</br>
            Out in the ocean</br>
            I don't even know where I'm going</br>
            Been a couple months and I haven't been smoking</br>
            I'm the first son so I came with the locusts</br>
          </br>
            I'm</br>
            Floating</br>
            In the ocean</br>
            Didn't even realize I was going through the motions</br>
            Brain full of fog make it really hard to focus</br>
            I don't get along with my own damn emotions, My</br>
            Ship sank from a leak in the bottom</br>
            Every game a home game, Harlem Globetrotter</br>
            I don't need connections I'mma throw away the solder</br>
            You can keep isolated in the darkness and the water</br>
          </br>
            I'm floating</br>
            Out in the ocean</br>
            I don't even know where I'm going</br>
            Been a couple months and I haven't been smoking</br>
            I'm the first son so I came with the locust. I'm</br>

            I'm the first son so I came with the locust. I'm</br>
          </br>
            Isolated how I wanna be</br>
            Ain't nobody judging me</br>
            Pleasure come abundantly</br>
            But it always lead to the suffering</br>
            There is way to much of me</br>
            I just wanna cut off the pieces, Or</br>
            Talk to Friedrich Nietzsche, Or</br>
            Bathe in some leeches</br>
            Human beings soft in the middle like Reese's</br>
            Talk about weakness</br>
            Slave mentality</br>
            You can't change you mind, you can change your whole reality</br>
            But I'm</br>
          </br>
            Floating</br>
            Out in the ocean</br>
            I don't even know where I'm going</br>
            Been a couple months and I haven't been smoking</br>
            I'm the first son so I came with the locust. I'm</br>

            I'm the first son so I came with the locust</br>
          </br>
            Had to scratch the bottom of the barrel</br>
            Praying for some booty and some extra dinero</br>
            I'mma spend it all on equipment and apparel</br>
            This is Adam at the fall, the resentment is apparent</br>
            Transparent, Translucent</br>
            Find a good thing, and I abuse it</br>
            I know one thing, that's the music</br>
            Won't drown, can't do it. I'm</br>
