          Metanoia
          <p>Metanoia, metanoia</br>
            I've been feeling paranoia</br>
            Feeling like I'm Meliodas</br>
            Dragon Sin</br>
            Trying to ascend with the goats</br>
            Eat anything</br>
            I don't cross over the moat</br>
            I'mma do the most</br>
            Please don't choke</p>

          Take Me
          <p>Take me away</br>
            Or you can take me to church</br>
            Everyday</br>
            You hit me where it hurt</br>
            Take me away</br>
            Take me back to the better days</br>
            But the better days are yet to come (Yet to come)</br>
            Got my hair up in a bun</br>
            I'm just making music for fun (For fun)</br>
            Made a painting on a wall</br>
            Cave markings</br>
            Dearly departed</br>
            No Parkinson's, but I'm shaking</br>
            Shaking like a leaf in a tree</br>
            I just rolled up my tree in a leaf</br>
            To see is not belief</br>
            But if I told you you wouldn't even believe me</br>
            What I be seeing</br>
            In the night</br>
            Demons</br>
            Try...</br>
            Please don't try me cause</br>
            I just earned my stripes (My stripes)</p>

          A Boy Wearin' Girls' Clothes
          <p>Tell me</br>
            What you niggas really know about this</br>
            A boy wearing girls' clothes</br>
            A chest where the shirt goes</br>
            A dragon</br>
            Guarding a chest</br>
            Full of gold</br>
            A warrior</br>
            Planning to stop</br>
            But always goes</br>
            A house of cards</br>
            Ready to fold</br>
            The rules that bend</br>
            But don't break</br>
            The lover that only learned to hate</br>
            A case of rape</br>
            He beat the case</br>
            But could he beat the odds</br>
            I know it's odd</br>
            The path I trod</br>
            At least I tried</p>

          Dream Interpretation
          <p>Leave it in the past</br>
            Nigga this a blast</br>
          </br>
            Blast off like the rocket</br>
            Electrical socket</br>
            I ain't got the plug</br>
            I am not a thug (Thug tears)</br>
            These are tears dripping down my face</br>
            I ain't crying</br>
            My eyes are just sweaty</br>
            I'm really like Freddie Kruger</br>
            I pop up in your dreams</br>
            And you interpret it like</br>
            "What does this mean?" but</br>
            I'm really a nice guy, I'm never mean</br>
            I'm really a prince, I am not a king</br>
            I ain't been baptized</br>
            I ain't been crowned yet</br>
            My skin is black and</br>
            Really brown yeah</br>
            Electrical got the copper</br>
            Fuck 12</br>
            Fuck the coppers (Fuck em)</br>
            But I got the steel</br>
            Yeah it's hella real</br>
            Listening to heavy metal while I whip the wheels</br>
            I got different seals</br>
            My inner power sealed</br>
          </br>
            I don't know what's after this</br>
            I ain't take them acid hits</br>
            All I did was mushrooms</br>
            Hoping that the blood moon come soon</br>
            Praying that the death come too</br>
            I've been speaking to my death, and my presence is...</br>
            Really it's the nexus</br>
            Center of the mandala</br>
            Can't handle 'em</p>
